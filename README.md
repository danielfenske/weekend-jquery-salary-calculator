# Salary Calculator

## Description

The Salary Calculator is an application that records employee salaries and adds them up to report total monthly costs. Features of the application include an employee submission form and data table that lists all employees who made a submission. The total monthly cost section of the page will turn red when the cost exceeds $20,000.

UPDATED: I eventually thought of a potential situation where a business may want to see a list of other expenses, aside from salary, along with their total monthly costs. This prompted me to add an additional layer to this project, which now features a second tab that includes a second form and table for other expenses. This can be found by clicking on the "other expenses" tab at the top of the page.

### Duration 

The total duration of the project was roughly ~16 hours. 

### What problem was solved? 

The task at hand was to create an application that correctly received employee information and display it in a table list of all employee submissions.

Accomplishing the business need for this application led me to approach this problem by breaking down the project into several small steps. This was prioritized to ensure the code written was concisely, easy-to-read, and followed a logical path. Below are the steps I took to ensure the project was executed to this standard:

- Develop a project plan by outlining needs of the application
- Make a list of actionable items to execute and connect them to their corresponding file
- Produce framework for application and write structural code within index.html file
- Integrate a temporary layout by adjusting positioning within style.css file for easy readability and testing
- Create and test functions within client.js file and use console as reference for function outputs
- Integrate jQuery within client.js functions to receive employee submission and append to DOM
- Refine the overall look of the application using style.css file
