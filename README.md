# Salary Calculator

## Description

The Salary Calculator is an application that records employee salaries and adds them up to report total monthly costs. Features of the application include an employee submission form and data table that lists all employees who made a submission. 

### Duration 

This weekend project is implemented into the curriculum taught at Prime Academy. The total duration of the project was roughly ~16 hours. 

### What problem was solved? How did you solve it?

Accomplishing the business need for this application led me to approach this problem by breaking down the project into several small steps. This was prioritized to ensure the code written was concisely, easy-to-read, and followed a logical path. Below are the steps I took to ensure the project was executed to this standard:

*Develop a project plan by outlining needs of the application
*Make a list of actionable items to execute and connect them to their corresponding file
*Produce framework for application within index.html file
*Integrate a temporary layout by adjusting positioning within style.css file for easy readability and testing
*Create and test functions within client.js file and use console as reference for function outputs
*Integrate jQuery within client.js functions to receive employee submission and append to DOM
*Return to style.css file and refine the overall look of the application
